$$Desert
You've reached an area that apparently has not seen any form of precipitation
for years.  This is the desert.  Vegetation is sparse, and what little there is
seems to be barely clinging to life.  It is hot, and you can already feel a painful
dryness in your nose and throat.
@
You see a shimmering on the ground in the distance -- could it be water?
The ground here is very soft sand.  You nearly lose your footing.
There is evidence that water once flowed here.  It is hard to tell if it was recently or long ago.
You see movement out of the corner of your eye.  Whatever is was is gone by the time you turn to look.
You hear a distant baying, like that of a coyote or fox.

a giant skeleton of some long-dead creature.
suspicious ground that looks like it could be quicksand.
a cluster of large thorny cactus.
a very deep crevasse.
some jagged boulders.

$$Forest
You're entering a forest.  Ancient trees hundreds of feet high surround you.
Not much light penetrates down to the forest floor, so there is relatively
little undergrowth.  A faint earthy organic smell fills the air.
It is peaceful and quite beautiful here, but you have
and odd feeling like you're being watched.
@
You hadn't realized until now how much background noise there was.  It's just suddenly stopped, and the silence is deafaning.
Some kind of furry woodland creature scurries by not too far away, too fast for you to make out exactly what it was.
The sound of rushing water can be heard, but you can't tell exactly which direction it's coming from.
You've entered a very small clearing.  Oddly enough it seems to be a nearly perfect circle.
A huge old dead tree falls with little warning.  You jump out of it's path just in time to avoid being crushed!
@
a large fallen tree.
a cliff.
a very dense thicket.
a large pond.
a thick curtain of vines.
