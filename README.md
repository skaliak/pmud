single player "mud" with procedural generation

Unlike "old-skool" muds from years ago, the room, item, and creature descriptions and the connections between rooms are
generated procedurally.  

Right now it's not really a mud, because it's single user.

Basic functionality that works is:
- map generation, including randomly dispersed obstacles, items (weapons), creatures, regions, etc
- collecting items
- navigating from room to room
- fighting creatures

A few things on the TODO list:
- make weapons actually affect combat (i.e. damage level)
- make creatures randomly move from room to room
- allow the map to be printed to the screen
- signposts (e.g. "<region> 10 east")
- other item types with other effects
- multiplayer???
